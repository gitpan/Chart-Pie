-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chart::Pie version 0.90
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This is the first version (and my first CPAN module) of a general
purpose, pie-graphing module.  It is really a subclass of David Bonner's
Chart v0.99 module, which currently supports easy generation of line,
bar, point, point-and-line, stacked bar, and composite charts.  This
module adds the support for pie charts.  As with the Chart module, this
module also make use of Lincoln Stein's GD module for graphics
primitives.

   This is just a beta. It's my first attempt at a perl Module. 
Chart v0.99 is also in beta. So, use it at your own risk.

----------
INSTALLING
----------

The usual.

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

This should install to your site_perl directory.  The test script also
put samples of a pie chart in the samples/ directory.
